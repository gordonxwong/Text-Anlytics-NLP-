    "# Potential Innovative data to analyze Real Estate\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyse the investment opportunities of Real Estate, we have many kinds of data sources to analyse the properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tradition:\n",
    "### 1. The variables about the Properties themselves\n",
    "Location, sizes, property types(studios/apartments/houses/others), Floor Area Ratio，Greening Rates, facilities, debts/obligations and etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The variables about the External conditions\n",
    "Neighborhood culture, Good view, traffic accessibility, recreational centers, infrastructures, schools, hospital and ect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The variables about the Macroecnomic environment\n",
    "Annual GDP per capita growth rate in the regions, Unemployment rate in the regions and etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Innovation:\n",
    "Besides, we also have other new data sources nowadays for deeper analysis.\n",
    "### 1. Real Estate Agent data\n",
    "For some Real Estate Agents like Zillow, Airbnb and Redfin, they have many open source comments data for us to extract and analyse the comments of certain property.\n",
    "### 2. Real Estate Advisory Report\n",
    "For some Real Estate Consulting firm, they write lots of reports to analyse the regional ecnomics and the real estate markets or even the commercial zone. We could scrape the useful information for our analysis.\n",
    "### 3. Social Media data\n",
    "#### I) Comments of the properties themselves\n",
    "We could scrape the open source social media data(Yelp, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and etc.) to dive deep into the comments of the people, who might be the potential/existing customers.\n",
    "#### II) Comments of facilities in the neighborhood\n",
    "Moreover, the facilities in the neighborhood like a recreational center, good views and etc. will also have great premium of the properties. We could also analyse the comments of the facilities."
